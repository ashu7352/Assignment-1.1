    "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, data types can be categorized as either mutable or immutable based on whether their values can be changed after they are created. Here's an explanation of the difference between mutable and immutable data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Data Types:\n",
    "Mutable data types are those that can be modified after creation. This means that you can change their values or content without creating a new object. Examples of mutable data types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you modify a mutable object, such as adding or removing elements from a list or updating values in a dictionary, the object itself is modified in place. Other references to the object will also see the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Data Types:\n",
    "Immutable data types, on the other hand, cannot be modified once they are created. If you want to change the value of an immutable object, you have to create a new object with the desired value. Examples of immutable data types in Python include integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, strings, and tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform operations that seem to modify an immutable object, such as concatenating two strings, you are actually creating a new object with the combined value. The original objects remain unchanged, and any references to them will still have the original values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between mutable and immutable data types is important because it affects how you can manipulate and work with objects. Mutable objects are useful when you need to modify their content dynamically, while immutable objects provide guarantees about their values and can be safely shared and used in different contexts without the risk of unintended modifications."
